Will your family photos you take now be available in 125 years?

Below are some scans of prints of my great-great-grandfather and wheelwright Henry Boddington in 1891 (top) and great grandfather, Reginald Boddington in 1964, being interviewed for a BBC TV programme, "In the Country". I earlier posted about some aircraft fuselages used to hold up their workshop roof. The top one is arguably just a 'snap' by modern standards; the bottom one maybe more of a keepsake. In either case, the longevity of the prints made it possibly to see them today. Can the same be said for digital media on home computer or 'in the cloud' in some 'secure service'? Get real people! Print your photos and keep them safe for the next generation!
